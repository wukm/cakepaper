History
------

- (2016-01-09) Updated style sheets to support bold titles instead of underlines


How to Use
------

Use `git` to clone the M.S. thesis template:

    git clone https://github.com/tgredig/CSULB_MSthesis
    
As the compiler use `miktex` with the appropriate GUI, on Mac that would probably be `TeXShop` and on Windows, it would be `WinShell`. If you do not want to worry about compilers
you can use the [ShareLaTeX environment](http://www.sharelatex.com) online and upload these files. Moreover, for tables an onlinen generator is
really useful, such as [TableGenerator](http://www.tablegenerator.com).

Steps:
+ copy default.manuscript/ folder to manuscript/
+ try to compile `Thesis.tex`
+ modify the thesis title, your name, and the thesis committee members in `Thesis.tex`.
+ Complete the files in the manuscript folder.
+ recompile.
