\chapter{Conclusion}

Brief recap.

\section{Review of Work}

Estimation of success. Areas of success and struggle.

\section{Future research directions} \label{sec:future-research-directions}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Solve the Network Connection Problem (PICTURE OF GAPS)
	Try something like \cite{laptev2000automatic}.
	\item Refine variable thresholding and automate.
	\item Combine with a ridge search.
	\item Use this as pre-processing for a Neural Network or something
	(cite kara's work, katalinas work)
	\item Apply to more image domains (STARE, WORSE PLACENTAS, ETC.)
	\item Automate Measurements (more quantative results too)
	\item Optimize; Better Use of Scales
	\item Use of Color Data
\end{itemize}
