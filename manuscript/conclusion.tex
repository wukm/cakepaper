\chapter{Conclusion} \label{ch:conclusion}

We justified the use of differential geometry in 2D discrete image processing to effectively re-establish the usefulness of the Frangi filter for identifying curvilinear content in digital images. We improved upon the implementation of the Frangi filter and provided several modifications of the Frangi filter--namely to normalize the filter's output each scale to allow us to choose a structureness parameter more freely, and more deeply examined the effectiveness of various parametrizations.

Our improved implementation allowed us to calculate our result faster, incorporating many scales. We also rationalized choosing stricter parameters for our particular agenda of extracting the PCSVN for placental images. We used our multiscale Frangi vesselness measure to suggest several alternative approaches at merging the vesselness and compared their effectiveness as a precursor to segmentation and eventually network completion. Finally, we discussed several promising research directions by which to improve our result and further approach our goal of complete PCSVN extraction.
