\begin{itemize}
	\item Solve the Network Connection Problem (PICTURE OF GAPS)
	\item Refine variable thresholding and automate.
	\item Combine with a ridge search.
	\item Use this as pre-processing for a Neural Network or something.
	\item Apply to more image domains (STARE, WORSE PLACENTAS, ETC.)
	\item Automate Measurements (more quantative results too)
	\item Optimize; Better Use of Scales
	\item Use of Color Data
\end{itemize}
