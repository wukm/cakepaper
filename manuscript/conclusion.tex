\chapter{Conclusion} \label{ch:conclusion}

We justified the use of differential geometry in 2D discrete image processing, and vastly improved upon the implementation of the Frangi filter. Our improved implementation allowed us to take more steps in our multiscale method and thus choose stricter parameters for Frangi scale. We used our multiscale Frangi vesselness measure to suggest several alternative approaches at merging the vesselness and compared their effectiveness as a precursor to segmentation and eventually network completion.

\section{Future research directions} \label{sec:future-research-directions}


Our goal is to eventually solve the network connection problem.
\begin{itemize}

	\item Solve the Network Connection Problem (PICTURE OF GAPS)
	Try something like \cite{laptev2000automatic} or use of principal curvatures.
	\item Implement the automatic scale selection and normalization of derivates as mentioned in Lindeberg \cite{lindeberg1998feature} to relieve ourselves of
        our current dependency on manual selection of $\sigma_{\min}$ and  $\sigma_{\max}$.
	\item Look into gradient prefiltering more as well as varying $\gamma$ more, especially in areas where we suspect the network could be completed.
  \item Look into using signed frangi arguments.
	\item Use this as preprocessing for a Neural Network.
	(cite kara's work, katalinas work)
	\item Apply to more image domains (STARE, other placental domains).
	\end{itemize}
