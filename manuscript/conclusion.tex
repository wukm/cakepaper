\chapter{Conclusion} \label{ch:conclusion}

We justified the use of differential geometry in 2D discrete image processing to effectively re-establish the usefulness of the Frangi filter for identifying curvilinear content in digital images. We vastly improved upon the implementation of the Frangi filter and provided several modifications of the Frangi filter--namely to normalize the filter's output each scale to allow us to choose a structureness parameter more freely.
Our improved implementation allowed us to calculate our result faster, incorporating many scales. We also rationalized choosing stricter parameters for our particular agenda. We used our multiscale Frangi vesselness measure to suggest several alternative approaches at merging the vesselness and compared their effectiveness as a precursor to segmentation and eventually network completion. 

Any additional research on this problem that wishes to use the Frangi filter as a prefilter  (e.g. the trough completion method detailed in \cref{ch:segmentation} or some more involved algorithm) will likely need to solve the network completion problem, which we addressed briefly at the end of \cref{ch:segmentation}.
