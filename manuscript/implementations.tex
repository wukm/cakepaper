\chapter{Algorithms and Implementations}
\vcomment{This chapter shows how things described within the research protocol are performed. By separating it out, I can focus on things like verifying accuracy / comparisons / demos / pseudocode without cluttering up the discussion of the actual methodologies of the next chapter. That way parameters choices, etc. can be more clearly highlighted. However, this section is apt place to discuss how varying parameters influences whatever methods are being used.}
