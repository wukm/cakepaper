\chapter{Mathematical Methods}

\textit{(Note: this can be 50 pages long. Don't focus on brevity--rather make it basically self-contained, within reason)}

Relevant math in no particular order. Focus on mathematics (primarily on a general image, rather than focusing on a particular image domain)


\section{Overview of Differential Geometry in Image Processing}
	\subsection{Basics, Definitions}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item basic definitions from differential geometry in $\mathbb{R}^3$
	\item basic image processing setup and nomenclature
	\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Calculating Derivatives of Discrete Images} 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Pretend the image is continuous surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
	\item Why gaussian blur is the way to go (see paper i forget whose)
	\end{itemize}
	\section{Frangi Filter}
	\subsection{Intro to Hessian-based filters}
	Describe $H_{xx}, H_{xy}, H_{yy}$. What the principal curvatures and directions are and mean. Basic properties and observations. Why these filters make sense. Basic strengths and weaknesses.
	\subsection{Overview of Frangi vesselness measure} keep it simple. this maybe should just go in the next chapter
	\subsection{Implementation Details: Convolution Speedup}
	how you do fourier stuff. as long as necessary
\section{Linear Scale Space Theory}
	\subsection{Why it matters}
	\subsection{Overview of Theory}
	\subsection{methods of "merging"}
\section{Other Odds and Ends} Finding the placental plate? Morphology stuff like skeletonization.
