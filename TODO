TODO for the paper:
! - quick
~ - complicated / involved / fuzzy / rerunning code
? - decision involved

0. Multisection
---------------
    A. [~] Use correct style sheet
    B. [~] Consistent coloration of graphs (nipy-spectral or plasma/magma?).
    C. [!] Fix chapter titles

1. Introduction
---------------

2. Mathematical Methods: Differential Geometry and Surface Curvature
--------------------------------------------------------------------

3. The Uniscale Frangi Filter
-----------------------------

4. Linear Scale Space Theory
----------------------------

5. The Multiscale Frangi Filter
-------------------------------

    A. Make sure rest of paper reflects that simple thresholding was moved here
6. FFT-Based Discrete Derivatives
---------------------------------

7. Morphological Image Processing
---------------------------------

8. Research Protocol
--------------------
    A. [?] Decision Tree is Better Formatted or as a Diagram (with the
        alternate steps just within the body)

9. Results and Analysis
-----------------------
    A. Decision Tree as flow chart or just in paper
    B. Remerge / Reallow Thesholded/Percentile Segmentations but just for
        demo purposes. give them scores later
    C. [~] Calculate CVR of "bad samples"

10. Segmentation
----------------

11. Trough Filling and Primitive Network Completion
---------------------------------------------------

    A. Merge trough filling into the segmentation section and discuss the results there

12. Conclusion
--------------
