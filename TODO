[!] - quick
[~] - complicated / involved / fuzzy
[.] - incremental (make sure gets done but don't need to do directly)
[#] - involves running code
[?] - decision / external input required
[_] - other / undecided


0. Multisection
---------------
    A. [~] Debug correct style sheet
    B. [#] Consistent coloration of graphs (nipy-spectral or plasma/magma?).
    C. [?] Less awkward way to describe figure grids (not inline or smoothly
            inline).  This also involves standardizing subfigure titles.  

1. Introduction and Abstact
---------------------------
    A. [?] Realign context with current developments in research group

2. Mathematical Methods: Differential Geometry and Surface Curvature
--------------------------------------------------------------------
    A. [~] Replace hand drawings

3. The Uniscale Frangi Filter
-----------------------------
    A. [~] Another editing pass

4. Linear Scale Space Theory
----------------------------
    A. [~] Edit pass

5. The Multiscale Frangi Filter
-------------------------------
    A. [#] Visual demonstration needs to have
        - Fixed threshold examples
        - Example of lower percentile (like 90 or 85)
    B. [!] Develop / migrate discussion of "automatic scale selection" here

6. FFT-Based Discrete Derivatives
---------------------------------
    A. [~] Standard proofing
    B. [?] Rework as just 1D; some of this is really unnecessary

7. Morphological Image Processing
---------------------------------
    A. [~] Write this section (as brief as possible)
    B. [~] Include thinning algorithm if you 

8. Research Protocol
--------------------
    A. [?] Decision Tree is Better Formatted or as a Diagram (with the
            alternate steps just within the body)

9. Results and Analysis
-----------------------
    A. [~] Calculate CVR of "bad samples"
    B. [~] In what's labeled Figure 23 in this chapter, explain what the
    scalewise percentile alphas are.
    C. [~] Last two figures lack a write-up. Decide if you want to include these, as
            they really don't communicate the ideas well at all.
    D. [~] Include discussion of network completion and principal directions here

10. Segmentation
----------------
    A. [~] Fix figures
    B. [?] Remove some segmentation methods 
    C. [ ] Show numerical results!


11. Conclusion
-------------
    A. [_] Standard Proofing
    B. [~] Move any development things to analysis, this is summary only
