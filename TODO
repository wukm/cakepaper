Tags

[!] - quick
[S] - style only (not that it isn't important)
[#] - involves running code
[~] - complicated / involved / fuzzy
[.] - incremental (make sure gets done but don't need to do directly)
[?] - decision / external input required


0. Multisection
---------------
    A. [#] Consistent coloration of graphs (nipy-spectral)
    B. [# S] Redo inline descriptions of subfloat arrays (use subfigure titles)
    C. [#] Insert some words about morphological image processing somewhere.

1. Introduction and Abstact
---------------------------
    A. [?] Realign context with current developments in Chang research group
    B. [!] Recapture focus of thesis

2. Mathematical Methods: Differential Geometry and Surface Curvature
--------------------------------------------------------------------
    A. [~] Replace hand drawings
    B. [ ] Redo differential geo discussion just in terms of graphs

3. The Uniscale Frangi Filter
-----------------------------
    A. [~]

4. Linear Scale Space Theory
----------------------------
    A. [~] 

5. The Multiscale Frangi Filter
-------------------------------
    A. [#] Visual demonstration needs to have
        - Fixed threshold examples
        - Example of lower percentile (like 90 or 85)
    B. [!] Develop / migrate discussion of "automatic scale selection" here

6. FFT-Based Discrete Derivatives
---------------------------------
    A. [~] 


7. Research Protocol
--------------------
    A. [~] Decision tree needs to be better formatted or as a flowchart
           (with the alternate steps just within the body)
    B. [~] Be clearer about UCIP stump removal

8. Results and Analysis
-----------------------
    A. [~] Calculate CVR of "bad samples" or recalculate what constitutes "good"
    B. [#] Colorbar for 3x3 scalewise parametrizations
    C. [~] Last two figures lack a write-up. Decide if you want to include these, as
            they really don't communicate the ideas well at all.
    D. [~] Include discussion of network completion and principal directions here
    E. [~] With arrow annotations, use a colored legend. Redo Vmax output as BW.
    F. [#] Redo CVR results, excluding UCIP to be consistent with Seg. chapter

9. Segmentation
----------------
    A. [~] Show more data somehow (insets? bad samples?)
    B. [#] For segmentation results, redo mask color
    C. [ ] Merge numerical results of each parametrizaton into same boxplot for more
           readable result
    D. [~] More analysis! Be more honest about what is bad at least? More open about
           improper scale selection?
    E. [~] Remove or incorporate scalewise RW demo into results (maybe move to the
           discussion part instead)

10. Conclusion
-------------
    A. [~]

11. Appendix
------------
    A. [#] Decide what code to include as an example (if any)
